          Science communication to the general public is often lacking. Papers
          are tedious and confusing even when the results are interesting and
          relevant. Articles tend to just list the results, making it hard for
          people to contextualize them.
          <br /><br />
          This site is an example of how we can do better. Everyone knows
          exercise is good for you, but most people don't know exactly how it's
          good or how much they need to do. This discourages people from making
          a plan - they instead always feel guilty about not doing more.
          <br /><br />
          By interactively linking hours of exercise to health outcomes, I hope
          this site motivates people to make a plan. The plot shows how even
          small amounts of activity translate to huge reductions in mortality
          from common diseases.
